# Customer-Churn-ML
This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict customer churn using a dataset from the telecommunications industry. Key steps in the process include data observation, cleaning, and visualization, followed by preprocessing and feature engineering to prepare the dataset for analysis. 

The project uses a **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** classifier to predict customer churn based on features such as age, tenure, churn score, and satisfaction score. Through the use of **GridSearchCV**, the optimal value of **K = 87** was determined, resulting in an accuracy of **95.17%**. 

Evaluation metrics like **confusion matrix**, **F1 score** (0.91), and **recall score** (0.855) are used to assess model performance. The learning curve highlights the misclassification error across different training sizes, providing insights into model generalization.
